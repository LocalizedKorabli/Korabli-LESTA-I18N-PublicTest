"The unique Surcouf submarine cruiser was designed in the mid-1920s as a vessel capable of fulfilling the role of both a submarine and a surface cruiser.\n"
"\n"
"The submarine's armament included several torpedo tubes of mixed calibers—400 mm and 500 mm—in triple mounts, a few small-caliber anti-aircraft guns, and a dual-gun turret featuring 203 mm caliber artillery. Additionally, the submarine carried a reconnaissance seaplane.\n"
"\n"
"The Surcouf submarine cruiser was built in Cherbourg. In the summer of 1940, it departed Brest for Portsmouth, avoiding capture by German forces but was later interned by Britain during Operation Catapult. In spring-summer 1941, it participated in escorting Atlantic convoys. The Surcouf submarine cruiser disappeared on the night of February 19, 1942, presumably due to a collision with an American freighter."

"The Marcello type submarines were an evolution of the large Glauco-class submarines initially ordered by Portugal but absorbed into the Italian fleet due to contract termination. The design was successful, featuring excellent maneuverability, speed, and armament, leading to an order of 11 vessels of this type. These were single-hull submarines with side bulges. In Italian classification, they were categorized as 'large cruiser' (or 'ocean-going') submarines.\n"

"Giacomo Nani was built at the CRDA shipyard in Monfalcone and entered service in September 1938, assigned to the 2nd submarine squadron. At the outbreak of World War II, Nani completed three unsuccessful patrols in the Mediterranean before being transferred to the Atlantic in autumn 1940. During its fourth patrol, the submarine sank a Swedish coal transport. Giacomo Nani went missing during its fifth patrol in early January 1941."
