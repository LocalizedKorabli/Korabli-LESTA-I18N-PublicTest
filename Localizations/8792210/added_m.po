"Gromoboy was a further development of the armored cruisers—commerce raiders 'Rurik' and 'Rossiya,' featuring a completely new power plant with three identical triple-expansion steam engines and improved armor.\n"
"\n"
"The cruiser was laid down at the Baltic Shipyard in May 1898, launched a year later, and commissioned in November 1899. Immediately after acceptance trials, the ship was transferred to the Far East, where it joined the Pacific Squadron.\n"
"\n"
"During the Russo-Japanese War, Gromoboy was part of the Vladivostok Cruiser Squadron. It took part in the Battle of the Korea Strait in August 1904. In October 1904, the ship was damaged in Posyet Bay. After repairs were completed in May 1905, it struck a mine and remained under repair until the end of the war. In 1906, the cruiser returned to the Baltic. It participated in World War I and remained in Kronstadt from the end of 1917."

"Boykiy was the lead ship in a series of ten torpedo boats, laid down in June 1901 and launched in August of the same year. It took part in the Russo-Japanese War, engaging in battles with torpedo boats and fighting in the Battle of the Yellow Sea. In December 1904, before the surrender of Port Arthur, it broke through to Chefoo, where it was interned. The ship was part of the Siberian Flotilla and underwent modernization between the wars.\n"

"From 1914 to 1922, it was in storage in Vladivostok. During the occupation of Vladivostok by Allied forces, the ship was captured by French forces and renamed 'Quentin Roosevelt.' After the departure of the interventionist forces, the cruiser was not reactivated."

In 1944, Błyskawica fought against German destroyers in the Battle of Ushant, covering the landing troops in Normandy. After being handed over to the new Polish government, the destroyer was modernized, with its main and anti-aircraft guns replaced by Soviet-made weapons.
