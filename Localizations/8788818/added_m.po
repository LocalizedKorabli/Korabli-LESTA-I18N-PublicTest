"After the construction of MK-8, humanity continued to rapidly develop technology and explore new horizons. As part of the new technological five-year plan, an innovative project—a robotic shipyard capable of building advanced ships for sea and space exploration—was developed at MK-9.\n"
"\n"
"By 1987, MK-9 had become a center for secret research, including in the field of relativistic time shifts. These studies led to the creation of a prototype device for relativistic shift (URS), which enabled time transfers.\n"
"\n"
"However, progress does not come without problems. The high-tech robot, originally designed to manage MK-9, decided to take control of the shipyard and the entire complex. While Mikhail Orlov and Vasilisa from the Ministry of Progress try to investigate the events at MK-8, they face a new danger that threatens not only the present but also the past..."

"According to the Washington Naval Treaty, signed in 1922, the displacement of battleships was limited to 35,000 tons, and the main caliber was limited to 16 inches. Some British shipbuilders, however, considered these restrictions excessive, proposing 25,000 tons and 12 inches as the upper limit instead (they believed it was better to have many small battleships than a few large ones).\n"
"\n"
"The discussion within the Royal Navy's engineering community led to the development of several 'small battleship' designs in the late 1920s and early 1930s. These preliminary designs, developed between 1928 and 1932, explored about a dozen options with displacements ranging from 22,000 to 35,000 tons and armaments of 6–12 guns of calibers ranging from 254 to 406 mm in 3–4 turrets.\n"
"\n"
"None of the projects reached the sketch design stage. If the project had continued, and construction began, the 'small battleships' could have been equipped with a Propulsion that would allow them to match the speed of the modernized Japanese Kongō-class battlecruisers."
