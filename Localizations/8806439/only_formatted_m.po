Over the course of several days in late May and early June 1940, more than 330,000 British and French troops were evacuated from northern France. To save their personnel, the Allies had to sacrifice all equipment and most of their weapons. 2,472 guns and nearly 65,000 vehicles of the British Expeditionary Force and French Army were left behind at Dunkirk. The British Admiralty involved more than 800 military and civilian ships—English, French, Dutch, Belgian.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>This included about fifty destroyers, dozens of minesweepers, trawlers, passenger steamers, yachts, fishing schooners, rescue and other ships. During Luftwaffe raids, artillery fire from the Wehrmacht, torpedo boat attacks from the Kriegsmarine, and on minefields, one in every four ships was lost. In nine days of evacuation, 145 British and 156 German aircraft were shot down in the battle for air supremacy over northern France. 'Wars are not won by evacuations', Winston Churchill said. However, as a result of the 'miracle of Dunkirk', the British army was saved and able to continue the fight against the Axis powers in other theaters. The evacuated French units formed the core of the Free French Forces.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>Four years later, the Allies returned to France in victory. The experience of organizing large-scale troop transportation at Dunkirk was used in 1944 during the Normandy landings, and Vice Admiral Bertram Ramsay and Captain William Tennant, who led the 1940 evacuation, became key figures in D-Day.</p>"

The Allies resumed escorting convoys in the Arctic to deliver equipment and armaments to the Red Army. All large ships of the Kriegsmarine gathered in Norway to prevent this. The British forces, with the assistance of the Norwegian resistance, were closely monitoring their location and movements, grasping every opportunity to incapacitate the enemy ships. In December 1943, only battleship Scharnhorst and a couple of destroyers remained combat-ready in Norway. To lure the armored beast from its lair, the Allies sent another convoy, JW-55B, on a course dangerously close to the Norwegian coast. A few hours from the convoy, the Distant Cover Force, headed by Duke of York, the flagship of the Home Fleet's Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Fraser, was steaming ahead, under the cover of a storm.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>Much was at stake: the shattered reputation of the Kriegsmarine, the last capable battleship of Germany, and a strategically important line for aiding the struggling Soviet Union.</p>"

msgid "IDS_PCQM092_SHIPS_DESCR"
msgstr "<p>During World War I, the evolution of warships of the major types revolved around the simple core idea of making them larger and stronger. The increasingly large caliber of their guns was complemented by their ever-stronger armor protection, which resulted in more significant water displacement and bigger proportions. For battleships, the race was initiated by the British when they designed a series of Queen Elizabeth-class warships with a sharp increase in their main gun caliber (up to 381 mm). Germany promptly responded with its Bayern-class super-dreadnoughts, which carried the same super-heavy artillery. The German ships, however, outmatched their rivals in terms of armor and combat durability. Their aim was to achieve superiority in quality, as it was impossible to compete with or match the sheer number of ships in the British fleet. Perhaps the only really important novelty in this race for world shipbuilding supremacy emerged when the Americans adopted \"all or nothing\" armor, not typical of warships of the pre-dreadnought era, on their Nevada-class battleships. The new scheme involved heavily armoring the areas most important to a ship, while the remainder received significantly less armor to emphasize protection optimized for long-range engagement. By a twist of fate, the strongest battleships of that period were eventually built by Japan, a country that had, until that time, stayed away from the main theaters of military activity. Hardly any rival ship was on par with their Nagato-class warships in terms of speed, armor and armament combined.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>During the war, only two European states could afford to build large series of new cruisers—Germany and Great Britain. The trends were the same: when the main caliber of the German cruisers reached 150 mm, the British designed ships of the Hawkins class with 190 mm guns, which became the prototype of a totally new subclass of ships—the heavy cruiser. The Americans and Japanese, in turn, carefully considered their military experience in relation to their own objectives. Built to scout for a fleet of U.S. battleships, the Omaha-class light cruisers featured high speed for cooperation with allied destroyers, and 152 mm guns to fend off any enemy destroyers that might be sent their way. The Japanese, in turn, reinforced their fleet of warships with several series of Kuma- and Nagara-class 5,500-ton light cruisers. Any of the them could be used as both a reconnaissance ship, and also as a command vessel for destroyer flotillas during massively overwhelming torpedo attacks.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>Destroyers were undoubtedly the most active fighting ships during World War I, which is why they would generally be considered the navy's expendable assets. In addition to raiding operations, patrolling and mine laying, this type of ship assumed another military role—anti-submarine warfare—which resulted in corresponding changes being made to their design and armament. The general trend, however, was the same: destroyers received ever more weapons, and the caliber of their guns grew, along with their displacement and speed. During the war, for the first time in the Royal Navy, a new sub-type of ships appeared: destroyer flotilla leaders, the role of which approached light cruisers in terms their characteristics and objectives.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>World War I demonstrated clearly that, during a global conflict, only a few economically powerful countries that had steered clear of direct combat were capable of building the major ship types on a massive scale. But it was clear even to them that the uncontrolled naval arms race was accelerating beyond their capabilities.</p>"

msgid "IDS_PCQM093_SHIPS_DESCR"
msgstr "<p>The economic consequences of World War I were so devastating that even the greatest winning states had to commit to something they once thought impossible—conclude a treaty on the limitation of naval armament. From 1922, for the first time in history, naval officials and shipbuilders had to be guided not by operational or strategic considerations, or optimal technical solutions, but primarily by the articles of the Washington Naval Treaty. This treaty contained restrictions on the number, displacement, and armament for the major types of the vessels of war. In addition, Germany, Russia, and Austria-Hungary ceased to rank among the naval powers at that time. It is not surprising, therefore, that the \"Washington Treaty\" period in the history of military shipbuilding turned out to be a rather difficult one.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>Firstly, no capital ships were allowed to be built for a period of ten years. At the signing of the treaty, the contracting powers retained their most advanced capital ships in their respective navies. The only exception was the Nelson class of British battleships built during that period. To comply with the limitations of the Washington Treaty, these ships were of an unusual design with all three main battery turrets carried forward of the ship's bridge, an arrangement unlikely to be used under normal circumstances.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>The Washington Treaty had a more profound effect on cruiser building. Cruisers were limited in terms of quality, but not numbers. Since battleships were no longer allowed to be built, the major naval powers began a competition to build \"treaty cruisers\" using the maximum values for technical specifications allowed by the treaty. To obey the limits on total cruiser displacement established for each navy, designers were forced to make compromises which normally affected armor protection. As a result, during the second half of the 1920s, Great Britain, France, Italy, the U.S.A., and Japan possessed ships boasting a high speed, a 203 mm main battery, and good seaworthiness, all at the cost of very weak armor. Warships of this new subtype, the need for which was never dictated by any objective naval warfare needs, were collectively known as the \"Washington Treaty Cruisers\".</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>The treaty for the limitation of naval armament likewise had an effect on the brand new type of warship—aircraft carriers. In 1922, the number of capital ships employed on fleet duties was sharply reduced. The hulls of the newest battleships and battle cruisers, which were being outfitted at shipyards, could either be scrapped, or converted into aircraft carriers. This way, by the end of the 1920s, the U.S.A., Japan, and Great Britain came to own large, high-speed aircraft carriers that were used to work through basic design solutions and tactics that were later adopted on this type of massively produced, purpose-built ship.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>The trends in the development of destroyers in the post-war years did not change—their size grew, and their armament became deadlier. France and Italy competed in creating ever larger and faster warships, equipped with increasingly more powerful artillery, eventually blurring the line between these ships and light cruisers. During the years of \"forced enthusiasm\" for the construction of \"Washington Treaty\" warships, only a few ships of this subtype were built. However, the real breakthrough came with the appearance of the Japanese destroyers of the Fubuki class and their successors—the Hatsuharu class. Powerful artillery, and most importantly, the crippling long-range 610 mm torpedoes coupled with a unique system of fast reload right at sea, propelled the destroyer forces of the Imperial Japanese Navy to a leading position in the world.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>Meanwhile, as the shock from the world war passed, Germany and the U.S.S.R., the heir to the Russian Empire, again sought to join the ranks of the world's leading powers on land and at sea. For many signatories of the Washington Naval Treaty, naval arms limitations became increasingly difficult to put up with.</p>"

msgid "IDS_PCQM094_SHIPS_DESCR"
msgstr "<p>In the first half of the 1930s, Great Britain made enormous efforts to maintain and strengthen the system of international naval armament limitation treaties. The reason was not pacifism among the British but that the weakening British Empire could no longer confidently hold the trident of Neptune. Two conferences were held in London in 1930 and 1936, resulting in the tightening of existing limits on the number, size, and armament of warships under the Washington Agreement of 1922. In addition, several new restrictions were introduced, which from then on applied to aircraft carriers, destroyers, submarines, and all cruisers.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>The agreements reached were largely devalued: Italy refused to sign them, and Japan withdrew from the naval agreement system altogether. Attempts to involve Germany and the USSR in bilateral treaties (under the Washington-London system) also failed, despite these countries' desire to enter the open seas from the mid-1930s.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>Nevertheless, the London naval agreements significantly influenced military shipbuilding. Since Japan and Italy refused to join the 1936 treaty, the United States, France, and Great Britain amended it, increasing the allowed displacement of capital ships. They also increased the main caliber from 356 to 406 mm. However, the British themselves designed and laid down their new King George V-class battleships with the previous displacement restriction and 14-inch guns. In turn, the Americans, consistently advancing toward the concept of fast battleships, managed to install 16-inch main guns on the new North Carolina and South Dakota-class battleships. The most balanced ships of this class, considering treaty limitations, were built in France — these were the Richelieu-class ships with 380 mm guns. This was a symmetrical response to the new Italian Littorio-class battleships. Finally, in the late 1930s, Germany rapidly entered the closed club of owners of full-fledged modern battleships with the excellently protected Bismarck-class ships.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>The London treaties had the most significant impact on cruiser construction. Subclasses of heavy and light cruisers were defined, with the construction of the former initially restricted and then banned altogether. This allowed Great Britain to focus on creating a new generation of light cruisers with 152 mm main guns — the British Empire needed many such ships. However, the emergence of powerful Japanese Mogami and Tone-class cruisers with 155 mm guns, which could easily be replaced with 203 mm guns, led to the need to enhance the combat qualities of light cruisers of the British Navy and the US Navy. Perhaps the most advanced heavy cruiser of the 1930s was the French Algérie, built as a single unit, while the best-protected were the Italian Zara-class cruisers. Among the light cruisers, the French La Galissonnière-class ships were considered the best in terms of cost-effectiveness and combat efficiency.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>As for destroyers, in the second half of the 1930s, powerful Japanese destroyers and fast French leaders were joined by relatively large, well-armed new German destroyers. Due to treaty limitations, the United States and Great Britain responded by creating lighter ships. They did not have outstanding characteristics or armament, but the powerful industry allowed them to be built in incomparably larger numbers.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>By the late 1930s, treaty limitations were virtually ignored. What held back a full-scale naval arms race among the great powers was only the diplomatic framework of propriety and peacetime budgetary constraints, but even these were abandoned with the onset of World War II.</p>"

msgid "IDS_PCQM095_SHIPS_DESCR"
msgstr "<p>World War II overturned the entire system of limitations on naval armament that existed in the 1920s and 30s, bringing international shipbuilding back to its natural state. From that moment on, every decision was dominated by the need for warships, production capacities, technology, and time. It is not surprising then that the United States was the only country that expressed a wish to build a series of battleships during these years. The Iowa-class battleships fit perfectly into the new format of naval warfare, changing their inherent role from hunting for high-speed Japanese battlecruisers to ensuring the stability of fast aircraft carrier strike formations. It is generally accepted that with all of their performance characteristics combined, they were the best battleships of World War II, but this honorary title is contested by the Japanese giants of the Yamato class. In contrast to them, the last battleship of the Royal Navy—Vanguard—looked much weaker, despite her excellent seaworthiness.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>A similar situation unfolded during World War II in cruiser building. It was possible in this period to create well-balanced and powerful ships, but only the United States and Great Britain had the resources to do so. As a result, the U.S. Navy received a large series of Baltimore-class heavy cruisers, the largest of their type, as well as light cruisers of the Cleveland class. The former ones were the strongest wartime heavy cruisers, balanced so well in terms of armament, armor protection, and seaworthiness that they remained in service for many years. Their enhanced versions served as the basis for the design of the Des Moines-class heavy cruisers equipped with auto-loading main battery guns, and these ships embodied all the experience gained during World War II. Armed with 203 mm main guns and representing the pinnacle of cruiser building under the Washington Naval Treaty, they were the best representatives of the latest generation of heavy artillery ships. In the light cruiser type, they were matched by the ships of the Worcester class, which also entered service after the war and carried a battery of 152 mm automatic dual-purpose guns.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>The most massively produced surface ships of the World War II period were destroyers, as they were involved in all impactful battles in all theaters of military activity. But despite mass production, the loss rate of this type of ship was the highest. Unlike heavy artillery ships, new classes of destroyers entered service during the war, not only in huge series joining the U.S. Navy (Fletcher, Gearing) but also in large numbers in the Royal Navy, as well as in noticeable numbers in Japan (Yūgumo, Akizuki) and Germany (various series of the 1936 class). After the war, new artillery destroyers were designed by those countries that could not afford to have larger ships in sufficient numbers. Fortunately, in terms of displacement and armament, the destroyers of that time often matched pre-war light cruisers: the Battle and Daring classes of Great Britain, the Halland class of Sweden, and the Friesland class of the Netherlands.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>The era when steam turbine-driven warships dominated the seas extended over a short period by historical measures—only about half a century, almost coinciding in time with the first half of the 20th century.

One set was fitted above the forward rangefinder tower located on top of the fore superstructure, and the other set was placed on the aft rangefinder tower.

These radars could detect an enemy ship at a distance of 25 km.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>However, during the Battle of the North Cape, the British ships surpassed Scharnhorst in both the quality and quantity of radar equipment. What's more, in an attempt to avoid detection, the radar systems on the Scharnhorst had been turned off. In doing so, Scharnhorst was unable to detect enemy ships in time. The first salvos fired by the British cruisers came as a total surprise to the German ship. One of the first hits crippled the forward FuMO 27 set.

In March 1943, a small squadron with Salt Lake City at the core intercepted the Japanese cover forces, escorting the transports with assault troopers on board, near the Komandorski Islands. The enemy force included two heavy cruisers, each of which was more powerful than their overseas counterpart. However, the U.S. squadron engaged in the fight and, within a few hours, Salt Lake City was boldly maneuvering and firing at an enemy twice as powerful as the American ship. The weak armor of the cruiser couldn't withstand hits of 203 mm shells, which nearly led to a tragic finale.

The U.S. ships, thanks to their radars, were the first to detect the enemy, but were inexcusably late to open fire. As a result, two columns, American and Japanese, literally collapsed one into the other on a dark tropical night, breaking the formation.

The 20 mm automatic Oerlikon, significantly improved by that time, proved to be very useful.

msgstr "<p>Reliability, a high rate of fire (up to 120 shots per minute), considerable height of engagement (over 6 km), destructive force of the shells (projectile weight of 900 g)—this all made the 40 mm automatic gun, developed by the Swedish company Bofors in 1930–1933, the most widespread AA artillery system. In the 1940s–1950s, it was used by dozens of countries around the world.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>Production of the 40 mm Bofors in the United States began in 1941, but the Swedish gun did not satisfy the Navy in many respects, so the Americans introduced many improvements in the mount's design using, among other things, the British version of the Bofors. The mass production of the 40 mm guns was deployed only at the end of 1942, yet they managed to satisfy the Navy's requirements in full only by 1944, when Bofors was able to finally replace the ineffective 28 mm Chicago Pianos on ships.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>The Bofors was produced in a variety of versions: with air and water cooling, in twin, quadruple, and single mounts, with manual aiming and with a power drive.

In such a situation, simply hitting a high-flying aircraft was not enough, it had to be destroyed in the air before it approached the ship. Small caliber Bofors and Oerlikon AA defense guns were not up to the task, so the U.S. Navy had to find a solution to the problem quickly.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>It was decided to return 76 mm guns to the AA artillery in more advanced power-driven mounts. Only after the war was the most efficient 76 mm AA gun developed—the twin Mark 33. This weapon which had a very high aiming speed (24 degrees per second horizontally, 30 degrees per second vertically), the ability to fire up to 50 shells per minute from each barrel, exhaustive destructive force of the projectile, with a maximum engagement of over 9 km in height, crowned the development of American AA defense systems in the 1940s.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>One of the first to receive Mark 33 mounts was light cruiser Worcester, commissioned in 1948.

These ships represented a breakthrough for their time, and defined the general appearance of destroyers not only in the British Navy, but also across the other leading navies of the world for a long time to come. Their large dimensions resulted in sea-keeping characteristics and sea endurance good enough to operate conjointly with battle squadrons. Another progressive solution was the placement of artillery guns in super-firing turrets, which later became a standard scheme for subsequent generations of destroyers.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>Following HMS Valkyrie and her sister ships, several further series of ships were built resembling her, in regard to arrangement and characteristics. From 1917 through 1924, a total of 67 ships were commissioned, collectively designated as V-class and W-class destroyers. Many of them remained in service until 1945, thus participating in World War I as well as being on active duty during the whole of World War II. Initially, HMS Valkyrie was a member of Harwich Force, whose main mission was carrying out escort operations in coastal waters.

They shared a \"standard\" arrangement, mainly inherited from the V and W classes, with water displacement of around 1,300 tons, a speed of around 35–37 knots, and armament consisting of four 120 mm guns and two 533 mm torpedo tubes. Initially, in 1936, the British Navy ordered eight I-class destroyers that were supposed to form one flotilla. It's worth mentioning though that their flotilla leader was built as part of a separate project.

However, these ships had just a few occasions to use their powerful AA defenses in practice.

Only in the early 1930s did the navy start to receive the first 40 mm AA Mark VIII guns, initially placed in octuple mounts. The new gun had the same barrel as the Mark II, which is why it inherited the pom-pom nickname. In 1935, a quadruple mount was designed which would become the basis for the AA armament of British destroyers starting from the Tribal class. The 2-pounder's rate of fire was around 100 shots per minute with its effective vertical range of fire being just a little above 1 km and the shell weighing a little over 900 grams.

The 11,000-ton HMS Hermes could carry two dozen planes onboard and reach a speed of up to 25 knots.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>HMS Hermes spent most of her peacetime service in the Far East, looking after the interests of the British Crown in the region. One of the tasks that she had to perform—quite unusual for an aircraft carrier—was to fight against pirates. At the beginning of World War II, Hermes, based out of African ports, participated in the search for German raiders and blockade breakers in Atlantic waters. In early 1942, she was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet and arrived in Ceylon. In April of the same year, the Japanese fleet launched a raid in the Indian Ocean. On April 9, HMS Hermes, on her voyage to join with the main forces of the Eastern Fleet, was intercepted and sunk by Japanese dive bombers.</p>"

msgid "IDS_PCZC297_BRITISHCVARC_HMS_FURIOUS_DESCRIPTION"
msgstr "<p>The story how one of the first British aircraft carriers, HMS Furious, was created is quite remarkable. It was laid down in 1915 as a ship of a unique type—a light battlecruiser. When, two years later, Furious entered service, she was a strange hybrid: on her bow she had a hangar with a flight deck, while her stern was occupied by a turret with a 457 mm gun, a monstrous weapon for its time. Furious would enter service three more times, following another modernization that changed her appearance. By 1932, she had been turned into an aircraft carrier with an island-type superstructure and flight deck occupying three-quarters of her hull's length. She was capable of accelerating to nearly 30 knots and carrying more than 30 aircraft onboard.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>At the beginning of World War II, HMS Furious hunted German raiders in the Atlantic. In the spring of 1940, she took an active part in the Norwegian operation. Later on, her main goal mostly consisted of transferring aircraft to various theaters of war, from the Arctic to Malta. In late 1942, she covered the landing in North Africa and, in 1944, she participated in striking battleship Tirpitz, based in Norway. A few months prior to the end of the war in Europe, the old ship was put into reserve and then removed from the fleet lists.</p>"

In the spring of 1945, she headed for the Pacific Ocean, with the largest air group onboard ever deployed on a British aircraft carrier—81 aircraft. Throughout a period of several months until the end of World War II, HMS Implacable took part in strikes against strategic targets on the Japanese islands. After the war, for a long time, the aircraft carrier served as a training ship to test out the latest models of carrier-based aircraft. In 1949, she was the flagship of the Home Fleet.

The transition of the city in 1918, under the rule of the Italian Crown, was of great importance for the development of the Regia Marina. The very first warship laid down after the war at the shipyard in Trieste—a 10,000-ton cruiser with 203 mm main battery guns—was named Trieste.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>The commemorative medal minted for those who served on this ship depicts a symbolic image of the city of Tergestum, the earliest recorded mention of which was attributed to Julius Caesar, as well as the cruiser's motto: \"Brought back liberated\" (Latin: \"Redente redimo\").

After the unification of Italy in 1861, the desire to claim this significant port passed \"by inheritance\" to the Kingdom of Italy. That desire was brought to life only following the results of World War I. By designating the newest heavy cruiser launched in 1930, the lead ship in a series of four, as Zara, the Kingdom of Italy made it clear to the whole world who the city belonged to. The symbol of Venice—the Lion of Saint Mark—depicted on a commemorative medal granted to the ship's servicemen, was reminiscent of the times when the city was under Venetian rule. On the same side of the coin the cruiser's motto: \"Persistent\" (Italian: \"Tenacemente\") could be found. </p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>After Italy entered World War II in June 1940, cruiser Zara did not even last a year. In March 1941, she was sunk by a British squadron in the Battle of Cape Matapan.

Because of this, Cap's ship received minimal damage—only a fragment from an HE shell smashed a cage in which five polecats resided.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>After the war, the British Navy was scaled down, and Cap received an advanced cruiser named Raleigh. Everything seemed to be just fine, until one day, when Cap was hurrying to reach L'Anse Amour, his ship ran ashore due to dense fog.

Fortunately, Cap always had plenty of high courage. Without a second thought, he accelerated and rammed the enemy!

But it turned out that it was not the villain he sought, but an allied cruiser—Sheffield. Fortunately, the Commander of the cruiser was a salted sailor, was actually alert, and expected a move of this sort from his allies. So he successfully dodged the torpedoes, all the while yelling out kind curses along the way that some might consider worthy of an officer of such high rank.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>That being said, on the second attempt, Cap finally managed to detect Bismarck and successfully torpedo her. Despite not causing much damage, one of the torpedo hits resulted in Bismarck's rudder being jammed.

Both ships enthusiastically grasped the chance to fill Bismarck with holes and send her to the bottom.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>But, just short of half a year later, destiny took her revenge on Cap.

For that reason, the main battery guns of Arizona—which have rested at the bottom of Pearl Harbor since December 7, 1941—managed to rain down fire on the enemy that had destroyed her. Three of the guns, those in the fore turret, can still be found on the destroyed battleship.

Their super-heavy 1,225 kg Mark 8 AP shells had an effect comparable with the 460 mm ammunition of battleship Yamato, while being considerably lighter. The matter of choosing the main battery for the fast battleships of the U.S. Navy caused a great many discussions in 1938.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>On one hand, the 406 mm/45 Mark 6 guns designed in the mid-1930s for the preceding North Carolina and South Dakota-class battleships were already considered to be the most powerful in the world. Compared with other large-caliber guns, they fired very heavy 1,225 kg shells that had a relatively modest initial velocity of 701 meters per second. The shell trajectory was more of an arcing one, and no armored decks of any existing ships were capable of withstanding these shells when fired from significant ranges. Because of this, there were no specific reasons to replace these guns with something new.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>On the other hand, depots in the U.S. stored over one hundred of the 406 mm/50 Mark 2 guns that had been produced throughout 1918–1922 for battleships that went unfinished due to the Washington Treaty on the limitation of naval armament. Owing to a longer barrel length, they possessed very high muzzle energy. This enabled an increase in armor penetration and firing range for the main guns of new ships with small material inputs. Lastly, the Naval Bureau of Ordnance proactively worked on the development of new 406 mm/50 guns that were lighter and more modern. This last factor resolved the issue: according to the estimates, the Mark 2 gun was significantly heavier than the Mark 6 and it required a bigger turret for mounting. This meant an increase in water displacement that would affect the major characteristic of future battleships—their top speed. Having considered all the factors, the General Council of the U.S. Naval Forces decided on the new guns for the main battery.</p>"

The Washington and London Treaties for the limitation of naval armament allowed France and Italy to build capital ships with a total displacement of up to 70,000 tons. Those requirements seriously affected the work of the French and Italian designers, who were forced to comply with the limits. Eventually, France refused to fulfill its obligation to restrict the displacement of the battleship to 35,000 tons—it seemed impossible to build a good modern ship under those conditions.
