Considering the concurrent evolution of \"Washington\" heavy cruisers in other countries, a symmetrical response would have been a design with heavier armament. The principal difference from previous designs lies in the universal-caliber guns—standardized with those planned for the H-42 battleship project. This solution would have allowed better cooperative AA defense within an order (battle group) against enemy aircraft."

In December 1945, an operational and technical plan for the Project 24 battleship was approved, where the ship’s main objective was to engage all classes of surface ships at both close and distant ranges. Development of the new battleship started at CKB-L in 1948, and by 1950 one variant of the preliminary design was approved.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>If such a ship had been built, then, based on operational experience, the second hull might have been completed to an updated design. Its 130 mm universal guns in BL-110A mounts would have been replaced by 152 mm guns in BL-118 mounts. The ship was conceived as an answer to the U.S. Iowa-class battleships, and featured 457 mm B-45 main guns mounted in SM-8 turrets.</p>"
