"The 350-ton torpedo boat project of the 'Buyny' class was ordered from the British firm Yarrow in 1897. The design was based on the series of torpedo boats of the 'Ikazuchi' type built for Japan. The ships were built in St. Petersburg in 1901–1902.\n"

"Boykiy was the lead ship in a series of ten torpedo boats, laid down in June 1901 and launched in August of the same year. It took part in the Russo-Japanese War, engaging in battles with torpedo boats and fighting in the Battle of the Yellow Sea. In December 1904, before the surrender of Port Arthur, it broke through to Chefoo, where it was interned. The ship was part of the Siberian Flotilla and underwent modernization between the wars.\n"

"From 1914 to 1922, it was in storage in Vladivostok. During the occupation of Vladivostok by Allied forces, the ship was captured by French forces and renamed 'Quentin Roosevelt.' After the departure of the interventionist forces, the destroyer was not reactivated."
