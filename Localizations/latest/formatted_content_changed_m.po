msgstr "<p>Isoroku Yamamoto was a Fleet Admiral and the Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II, and a graduate of the Naval Academy.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>The future naval commander was born into a samurai family. The discipline and warrior spirit of Takano Isoroku, who later became famous under the name Yamamoto, were forged in the Spartan atmosphere of the Naval Academy in Etajima. His first combat experience, while still an unknown officer, was the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905, the decisive naval engagement of the war with Russia. In the hours-long artillery duel between battleships and cruisers of Japan’s young navy and the fleet of one of the world’s leading powers, the cruiser Nisshin—on which Isoroku served—fought alongside battleships and sustained the heaviest damage. An explosion in a main battery turret riddled Takano Isoroku with shrapnel, yet he did not leave his post until the battle was over. The young officer’s bravery was acknowledged by the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet—Admiral Tōgō.</p>"

msgstr "<p>Admiral William Halsey was one of those who ensured the Allied victory in the Pacific War. It was he who achieved the decisive success in the battle for Guadalcanal and led the campaign for the Solomon Islands, paving the way to Japan. The admiral’s phrase “Hit hard! Hit fast! Hit often!” became the motto of the U.S. Navy in the Pacific campaign.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>William Frederick Halsey Jr. was a born sailor. He was born in the small port town of Elizabeth, New Jersey, near New York, into a family of naval officers. Among his ancestors were pirates and whalers—so his path in life, the path to the sea, was predetermined. In 1899, failing to secure admission to the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Halsey Jr. enrolled at the University of Virginia, hoping to join the Navy at least as a physician. From his time at the university, he mainly took away a passion for American football.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>In 1900, Annapolis finally opened its doors to the man who would become one of its most renowned graduates. However, at the Academy, the stubborn and headstrong “Shorty” Halsey did not excel academically—he graduated 42nd out of 62 in the class of 1904. The first ship of his naval career was the battleship Missouri. The significance of this assignment would only become clear more than forty years later.</p>"

msgstr "<p>Throughout history, the image of a ship has carried an aesthetic value beyond compare with any other work of human hands. For centuries, people were captivated by the boundless and mysterious allure of majestic sailing ships. But then came the “nineteenth, iron century...” and the industrial revolution accelerated humanity’s pace of life—replacing wood and wind at sea, nature’s gifts, with metal and steam.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>From then on, right up to the dawn of the space age, it was ships that embodied all the scientific and technological achievements of our civilization. And since the coming twentieth century would bring worldwide wars on an unprecedented scale, warships inevitably led the way in shipbuilding. Yet people continued to admire their precision and symmetry, their complexity and deadly power.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>When the twentieth century arrived, the world was entering it to the thunder of naval guns: the Sino-Japanese, Spanish-American, and Russo-Japanese Wars were largely decided at sea. Learning from those conflicts, the great powers’ navies developed new technical requirements for building warships of the main classes.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>In battleship construction, they moved on to building “dreadnought” types armed with eight to twelve 305 mm or larger guns, outfitted with a new armor layout, higher speeds (thanks to turbine engines), and improved survivability. The idea of such ships was discussed in many countries, but with its highly developed economy and shipbuilding, Britain pulled ahead—launching the revolutionary HMS Dreadnought, whose name became synonymous with this new type. Older battleships were rendered obsolete overnight, and all powers effectively started again in the naval arms race, with economic strength alone determining who would pull ahead.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>Cruiser design also became more specialized, producing large series of high-speed cruisers intended for operations within fleets. Speed became one of the main tactical and technical parameters. To achieve the necessary speed without enlarging displacement too much, cruisers moved from coal-fired piston engines to steam turbines with oil-fired boilers.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>This process was even more pronounced in destroyer design. Requirements for maneuverability and speed were drastically increased, allowing them to choose the best position and timing for a strike. Based on experience from recent naval conflicts, the role of destroyers grew significantly. They not only took part in battles but also carried out essential day-to-day duties—reconnaissance, patrols, and laying minefields. As a result, destroyers began to be armed with 102–120 mm guns, replaced fixed underwater torpedo tubes with deck-mounted rotating multi-tube launchers, and were equipped to deploy and recover large numbers of mines directly from the upper deck. Destroyers thus became a formidable opponent for surface ships of all classes.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>All these many innovations in warship design would be put to the test very soon—World War I erupted in 1914.</p>"

msgstr "<p>During World War II, the French Navy command of the Vichy regime issued a requirement for the development of a new generation of destroyers. The project known as T 42 was further evolved into a group of sketches under the common index E 43. During the design process, among other ideas, there were proposals to enlarge the ship to the dimensions of a light cruiser.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>The ship was to be armed with 120 mm or 130 mm guns, and the number of mounts on different sketches varied from three to four. Project E 43 was never realized, and subsequent work on it ultimately led to the creation of Project T 47.</p>"
