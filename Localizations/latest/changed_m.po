In his memoirs, he bitterly joked about the 'uniqueness' of his service, having been a rear admiral twice, vice admiral three times, and fleet admiral twice.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>In May 1955, the rank of 'fleet admiral' was renamed to 'Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union', with recipients receiving a special distinction - the Marshal's Star. The star was worn around the neck with dress uniform. Since 1952, admirals were required to wear a black jacket with gold epaulets and a gold-embroidered collar for parades. The cap badge also featured special embroidery.</p>"
