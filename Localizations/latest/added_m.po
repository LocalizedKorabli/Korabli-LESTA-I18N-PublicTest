However, the number of people who like it and the success of the Halloween campaign showed that PvE battles deserve further consideration.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>The first season of Operations came out with the release of Update 0.6.6 and offered four unique battle scenarios: defending a naval base, mounting an attack on a convoy, delivering a strike at a base, and escorting an aircraft carrier.
