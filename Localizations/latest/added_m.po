The Russian Empire lost the Kurils to Japan under the 1875 Treaty of Saint Petersburg, receiving Sakhalin in exchange. At that time, Russian expansion focused on the Amur and Primorye regions, shifting south to Manchuria by the early 20th century. Only in the 1930s did the USSR achieve significant economic development and population growth in this region—the Soviet Far East project became one of the era's landmark achievements. Meanwhile, Japan remained influential in the Far East. During WWII, the Kurils served as Japan's rear: carrier strike groups assembled here for the Pearl Harbor attack, and fish processing plants supplying the military operated here.</p><p class=\"p_spacing\"> </p><p>At the February 1945 Yalta Conference, it was agreed that the USSR would receive the Kuril Islands and southern Sakhalin (lost in 1905) in exchange for entering the war against Japan. On August 15 at 07:30, forces of the Kamchatka Defense District under Major General A.R. Gnechko received orders from the 2nd Far Eastern Front and Pacific Fleet commanders: occupy Shumshu, Paramushir, and Onekotan Islands.</p>"
