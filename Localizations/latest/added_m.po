"The third battleship of the Yamato class was laid down in May 1940 in Yokosuka, but construction was halted in December 1941. After the Battle of Midway, it was decided to complete the ship as an aircraft carrier. The half-finished hull of the battleship could not accommodate a sufficiently large hangar, limiting the number of aircraft. The torpedo defense was identical to that of the Yamato-class battleships, and the armor of the ammunition magazines, converted into aviation armament storage, remained unchanged, but the rest of the vertical armor was significantly reduced due to the need to reduce weight.\n"
"\n"
"Shinano was launched as an aircraft carrier in October 1944, and in November, the ship was commissioned, though it was not fully equipped. While en route for final outfitting from Yokosuka to Kure, the ship was attacked by the American submarine USS Archerfish on November 28. The carrier was struck by four torpedoes, capsized, and sank."
