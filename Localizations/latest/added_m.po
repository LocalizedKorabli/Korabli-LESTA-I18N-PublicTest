"John McPhee, editor of the local newspaper, suggested a stunt: a parachutist dressed as Santa Claus would jump from a plane and land outside the town. Police would then escort him to the parade to distribute gifts.\n"
"\n"
"On the parade day, the parachutist couldn’t make the jump. Quick-thinking McPhee used a mannequin dressed as Santa instead. When dropped from the plane, the parachute failed, and the mannequin crashed to the ground in front of horrified children.\n"

"McPhee tried to calm the children by dressing as Santa, but they believed Santa had died. He left town for a few days, but the story persisted, and he was forever known as 'the man who killed Santa Claus.'"
