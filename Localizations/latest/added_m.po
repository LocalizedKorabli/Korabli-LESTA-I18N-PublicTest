"Project 68K and 68-bis cruisers, completed in the USSR in 1945, lagged behind contemporary American cruisers like the Worcester and Des Moines classes. In September 1945, Admiral N. Kuznetsov approved technical requirements for a new cruiser with 152 mm or 180 mm guns, including universal mounts. Further design development led to preliminary designs for the KRL-22 and Project 66 medium cruiser, armed with 220 mm artillery.\n"

"Following a tactical simulation conducted in spring 1954, it was recommended to enhance the universal artillery while reducing the ship's weight by replacing the non-universal 220 mm guns with 180 mm universal guns. The 130 mm artillery could then be replaced with smaller universal mounts."
