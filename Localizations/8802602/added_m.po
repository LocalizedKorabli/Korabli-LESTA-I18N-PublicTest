It managed to photograph almost half the lunar surface, covering 30% of the visible side and 70% of the previously unseen far side. These images were declared the “photographs of the century.” Based on them, two volumes of the Atlas of the Far Side of the Moon and a lunar globe were published in 1960 and 1967.

Data from trajectory measurements indicated that Mars 1 would pass about 193,000 km from Mars, demonstrating great precision in launching the station on its intended trajectory. Sixty-one radio sessions were conducted, yielding a wealth of telemetry data. Over 3,000 commands were sent to the station.\n"
